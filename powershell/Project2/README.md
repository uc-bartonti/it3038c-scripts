Changed the script from javascript to powershell for project2. 
Looking at project 3 to expand over to javascript and add more elements. 

This script will take your budget and take out expenses to tell you the remaining budget

To run the script just type the full directory of the file and press enter.

Example 

C:\Scripts\powershell\project2.ps1

[Enter]
